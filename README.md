# tigerlake.xyz

### Source code for my little corner of the internet.

**Features:**
- Uses a [React hook](https://github.com/alii/use-lanyard) for [Lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard) to fetch what I'm currently listening to on Spotify.
- Fetches my top GitHub repositories, as well as my total stars/forks count using [ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration).
- Utilizes Discord webhooks to receive messages from those who fill out the contact form.
- Uses TailwindCSS for easy light/dark theme configuration.
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authenticating users so they can comment.
